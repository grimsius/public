This is what I do and it works for me:

1. Use JabRef to organize all articles, books, papers. Easiest way to populate all entries is to use http://www.doi2bib.org/#/doi
1. Make a folder in your cloud account which will store these PDFs and nothing else.
1. Link each JabRef entry with the respective PDF file which will reside in this folder.
1. Whenever you want to open a file, click the JabRef entry to open the respective file.

Even if your computer crashes, you won't lose anything because the database file would be safe in the cloud and even if you change the folder structure, the way JabRef handles file paths is relative so you can set everything up on your new computer quickly.
