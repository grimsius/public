I look up that information from the journal (etc.) website directly (or from the article pdf) and then input it manually into my bib file.

I have seen *far* too many problems arise from importing bib files from journal websites, Google Scholar, and so on.

But the worst is that many (most?) websites don't write their bib files by hand, but instead generate them from some other format, which often results in bib files with weird and/or hidden characters (e.g. control characters), which causes LaTeX to trip up and produce errors. If you spend a whole day or week reading and importing references for a literature review, and then go to write a LaTeX document that cites dozens or hundreds of bib entries, one or several of which contain a problematic character, you're going to have a bad time, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

So, for all these reasons, I prefer to curate my bib file by hand.
